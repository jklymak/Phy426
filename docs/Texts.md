The main course text is Kundhu and Cohen, latest edition, available at the bookstore.  Older
and newer versions should be fine, but you'll have to dig a bit if equation
numbers have changed etc. 

Kundhu and Cohen is good, but falls into the overly-abstract and
mathematical style of physics textbook. Don't let this discourage you
- in order to gain intuition, it is often useful to concoct simple
examples and see if your intuition is correct.

**Other texts**

  - Batchelor, *An Introduction to Fluid Dynamics*, 1967, is *the* classic
    in the field.  (on course reserve)  This book is quite
    mathematical, but also very verbose, with a *lot* of the intuition
    explained in great prose.  
  - Acheson, *Fluid dynamics* is a good text I learned from in graduate
    school (on course reserve)
  - Lamb, *Hydrodynamics*, 1867, is a tough read, but a classic.  (on course
    reserve and [online](http://www.archive.org/details/hydrodynamics00lambuoft/).)
