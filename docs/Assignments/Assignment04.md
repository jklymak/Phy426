## Reading (Participation only, very short answer)

  - Ch 7, sections 11 to 13 non-linear steepening waves, hydrualic jumps, solitons.


### R1: Why do waves tend to steepen?

Waves tend to steepen: why?

### R2: Jump condition

What two quantities are conserved across a hydraulic jump?

### R3: Solitary waves:

What two wave tendencies are balanced in a soliton?

## Assignment

 - Kiniematics
 - Conservation of mass

### A1: Streamlines in a corner flow (/10)

The flow in a 90-degree bend at the origin can be described by

$$u = y$$

$$v = x$$

  - Derive and sketch the streamlines $\psi$ of the flow, where $u = \partial \psi / \partial y$ and $v = -\partial \psi / \partial x$:
  - Contour the streamfunction on a computer
    - where in the flow would you put the walls to make this a flow in a corner?
  - Demonstrate analytically that the the flow is non-divergent.
  - Demonstrate that it is close to non-divergent in your computer code.


### A2: Multiple density mixing vat (/5)

Suppose we have a mixing vat, with one inflow at $q_1 = 2\ m^3\,s^{-1}$ and a fluid of density $\rho_1 = 1000\ kg\,m^{-3}$, and a second inflow with density $\rho_2 = 1030\ kg\,m^{-3}$, and an outflow with density $\rho_3 = 1028\ kg\,m^{-3}$.  What must the outflow rate be if the fluids are incompressible?
