## Course Description

Introductory Fluid Mechanics with a focus on applied natural world problems, including hydraulic flow over a weir in a channel, surface wave dynamics, lift due to flow over an airfoil, and onset of instabilities that lead to turbulence.

## Course Objectives

-	Improved ability to linearize and simplify problems using scaling laws
-	Better appreciation of exploring parameter space for complex phenomena
-	Improved ability to create and analyze numerical simulations
-	Practice demonstrating and explaining phenomena to classmates.

  - [National Committee for Fluid Mechanics Films](http://web.mit.edu/hml/ncfmf.html) are still excellent 58 years later.
  There are [written notes](http://web.mit.edu/hml/notes.html) as well.

## Course grading

  - 10% Class participation and attendance
  - 40% [Assignments and Readings](./Assignments/);
  - 25% [Student-led Laboratory Demonstrations](./Labs/);
  - 25% Take-home Final Exam

Late work penalized as 10% per day, max 5 days.  Academic concessions will be granted with appropriate documentation as per [UVic's regulations](https://www.uvic.ca/registrar/students/appeals/acad-concession/index.php).  Working together on assignments is acceptable, but they are to be handed in independently.  The final examination will be done individually.  Students are expected to follow the [UVic standards for academic integrity](https://www.uvic.ca/students/academics/academic-integrity/index.php).
