# Siphon
Repeat the experiment but with a hose that goes higher than the surface of the reservoir, but outlets below the surface of the reservoir.
## Experiment Setup
We established an upstream reservoir (the orange tank) to estimate the velocity of the siphon by measuring the projectile motion distance of the water flow from the siphon's outlet. As a control group in the experiment, a nozzle is positioned at the bottom of the upstream reservoir. The relationship between the nozzle's outlet water flow velocity and the water level was previously discussed.

## Theory

There are two main theories regarding how a siphon operates: the atmospheric pressure theory and the cohesion tension theory. The atmospheric pressure theory suggests that atmospheric pressure drives the water up the siphon, a concept that fails to explain siphon functionality in a vacuum. The cohesion tension theory proposes that water is pulled up the siphon like a chain, although it also faces challenges.

Bernoulli's equation provides a close approximation of flow in an idealized, friction-free siphon operation. Considering point 1 at the water surface and point 2 at the siphon's outlet, we have:

$$\frac{1}{2} v_1^2 + gz_1 + \frac{P_1}{\rho} = \frac{1}{2} v_2^2 + gz_2 + \frac{P_2}{\rho}$$

where $v_1$ is the velocity at the surface, $z_1$ is the height of the water surface, $P_1$ is the pressure at the surface, $v_2$ is the velocity at the outlet, $z_2$ is the height of the outlet, and $P_2$ is the pressure at the outlet. Given that the siphon opens to the atmosphere, we have $P_1 = P_2 = 0$, and $v_1 = 0$. Thus:

$$\frac{1}{2}  v_2^2 = g (z_1 - z_2)$$

Solving for $v_2$, we find:

$$v_2 = \sqrt{2 g (z_1 - z_2)}$$

## Experiment Goals

Our objective is to set up a siphon alongside the nozzle, aligning the outflows at the same height, to compare their velocities by measuring the distance water travels through the air. We aim to test the hypothesis that:
1. The outflow velocity of the siphon matches that of the nozzle.
2. The outflow velocity of the siphon is independent of the inlet height.

## Experiment Results

In the experiment, we positioned the siphon and the nozzle at the same height and observed that the siphon's outflow velocity was less than that of the nozzle, as indicated by the shorter air travel distance of the water. We also encountered difficulties in simultaneously measuring the outflow velocities of both the siphon and the nozzle due to alignment and measurement tool limitations.
