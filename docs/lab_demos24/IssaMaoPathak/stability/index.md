# Pressure and Buoyancy

For this part of the lab, we tested the stability to tipping for multiple objects.
1. Styrofoam cup (with and without an added weight)
2. A 3-D printed object with a heavy metal carriage acting as a ballast
3. A ball with an elongated helmet
4. A cylinder

In the following video, the stability of each of the objects is showcased.

As shown in the video, the styrofoam cup has three points where it will float:
i) the larger opening ii) the smaller bottom iii) the side of the cup.
The cup can be tipped at a larger angle and still return to the same point for the larger opening than the smaller bottom.
This makes sense because there is a larger area for the cup to find equilibrium.
When the weight is added to the cup, it falls to a new stability point which is at an angle, rather than flatly on the side, because the extra weight is not fixed and shifts to push the cup under the water rather than float on top.

Next, the object with the ballast has its stability point when the ballast is in the water.
Even if the object was completely flipped on its back, it rotates around so that the ballast will be underneath again.
The ballast keeps the object from tipping over, although not displayed in the video, such that even when pushing down on the side of the boat it will return back to its stability point.
The reason that the ballast works is because it is heavy enough to shift the centre of gravity lower than the object, meaning that any torques that object + ballast experience are around the ballast, which wants to sit flatly in the water.

The ball with the helmet has a stability point where the ball is in the water and the helmet is sitting flatly.
The object will even undergo multiple rotations to find this position, as shown in the video.
No other point could be found where the object was stable, it always wanted to return to this stability point no matter its orientation.
This is due to the geometry of the helmet and that the ball is acting similarly to a ballast.

Finally, we have the cylinder. The major stability point for this object was on its side, but for very small angles we got it to float on its surface once (although not shown in the video).
Another thing we tested, although forgot to film, was adding a ballast to one side of the cylinder.
When placed on its side or the opposite face, the object would rotate so that the ballast would be floating under the water and allow for the cylinder to remain upright.
