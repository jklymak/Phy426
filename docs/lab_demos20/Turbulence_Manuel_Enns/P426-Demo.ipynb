    "#### What is turbulence?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Turbulence is fluid motion in which there are chaotic changes in flow velocity and pressure\n",
    "* turbulence is strongly non-linear (making it hard to calculate)\n",
    "* Turbulent flow is characterized by high reynolds numbers\n",
    "* Examples of turbulence are:\n",
    "    - surfing\n",
    "    - fast flowing rivers\n",
    "    - weather and storm clouds\n",
    "    - smoke from a cigarette\n",
    "    - the flow over vehicles such as cars, airplanes, and submarines\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The reynolds number:\n",
    "\n",
    "The reynolds number is given by the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Re = \\frac{\\rho VD}{\\mu} = \\frac{UD}{\\nu}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\rho$ = density of the fluid, V = U = velocity of the fluid, $\\mu$ = dynamic viscocity, $\\nu$ = kinematic viscocity = $\\frac{\\mu}{\\rho}$, and D = diameter\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is easier to produce turbulence in fluids that have low viscosity. I.e.) If you disturb Water and Corn Syrup in the same way, the water will have more turbulence\n",
    "* We will be producing turbulence in air and in water in the demos\n",
    "* The kinematic and dynamic viscocity for air and water are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Table 1: Dynamic and Kinematic Viscocities of Air and Water\n",
    "\n",
    "| Fluid Type | Dynamic Viscocity ($\\mu \\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s}$) @$27^{\\circ}$ C  | Kinematic Viscocity ($\\frac{m^2}{s}$)|  \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Turbulence vs. Laminar Flow: \n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the properties of a flow, it can be charactergorized as Laminar or Turbulent flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Turbulent flow has the following properties:\n",
    "    - Has chaotic fluid flow with flow instabilities\n",
    "    - Inertial forces dominate\n",
    "    - Have high reynolds Numbers (Re>4000)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Laminar flow has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Has smooth, constant fluid motion\n",
    "    - Viscous forces dominant\n",
    "    - Have low reynolds numbers (Re<2100)\n",

    "In this demo, turbulent airflow is measured around a box. Since vortices occur on the downwind size of a building or obstacle, we can measure the distance where turbulent flow takes place on the downwind side of the box as a function of box height. This is done by measuring the streamlines of airflow from a fan using a “streamer”. The distance from the downwind side to where the turbulence dies off can be measured for different heights using three boxes.\n",

    "\n",
    "First we tied streamer to the end of pole, and placed a box $42.5\\pm 0.1 \\mathrm{cm}$ in front of the fan with the fan on the highest setting. Standing off to the side of the fan, the streamer was held just below the top of the box on the downwind side and the streamer was slowly moved away from the box. Chaotic motion in the streamer characterized by turbulent flow was observed until the streamer direction began to flow only away from the fan, at which piont the pole was lowered to the ground, and the distance of the turbulent zone was measured from the box to the box using a measuring tape. This process was repeated three times for accuracy and then a new box was added on top and was repeated for a total of three boxes.\n",

    "We were expecting a linear relationship between the turbulent distance and the height of the boxes. However, there was a linear relationship only between the first two boxes (although there will always be a line between two points). Possible errors in the experiment causing the third box to not obey this linear relationship include the fact that the initial assumption was that the boxes were suppose to be at the same height, but they instead had different heights. Additionally, the height of the third box exceeded the height of the fan, thus the flow was not straight as compared to with the other boxes."

Since the fluid velocity is slow, we can observe some smooth streamlines in addition to eddies and turbulence. If the fluid flow was faster, more eddies would form which would make the fluid flow more turbulent and hard to predict.\n",

    "\n",
    "Engineers and scientists use CFD Analysis (Computational fluid Dynamics) to show velocities, pressure, gradients, and flow around objects. This is expecially useful to an engineer designing different kinds of objects, like buildings or cars to see how different fluids like air or water are going to interact with them. They might be interested in detecting turbulent flow around a car for example.\n"

Laminar flow was observed from a smooth hole of approximately the same size. The laminar flow occured quicker than the turbulent flow, due to the way the bottle is shaped with a gradual transition in volume to the smooth hole, and due the friction of the jagged hole with the water slowing it down.\n"
