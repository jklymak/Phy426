The pressure of water above the hose opening *inside* the tank can only force water out the other end up to the surface height.

    "## Bernoulli Apparatus\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bernoulli aparratus is used to demonstrate how a pressure gradient can accelerate a fluid. The apparatus (Figure 1) consists of a pipe which starts with a cross sectional area $A_0$ that then tapers inward to an area $A_1$. The pipe is connected to a pump which forces water through the pipe. Along the pipe there are a number of outflows to vertical tubes where the water level indicates the pressure at that location along the pipe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turn on the pump and open the valve to allow outflow. Let it run until all the air bubbles have been removed. Close the valve so there is no longer any flow. Without flow the pressure becomes the same along the pipe. This is indicated by the equivalent height of water in the vertical tubes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the valve so that there is once again flow through the pipe. In a steady flow the inflow = outflow, so that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\rho v_0 A_0 = \\rho v_1 A_1 $$\n",
    "Therefore:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v_1 = \\frac{v_0 A_0}{A_1}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "If $A_0 > A_1$ then $v_0 < v_1$. The flow is accelerated from $v_0$ to $v_1$ along the pipe by a pressure gradient force visible in the vertical tubes, as there is high pressure at the wide end and low pressure at the narrow end. The pressure gradient manifests when the water starts to flow from rest and then 'runs into' the tapered pipe, which causes a compression wave that acts to builds up a sufficient amount of pressure to force the flow through the narrowing pipe. Although we often consider water to be incompressible, it is actually slightly compressible, else the compresion wave, which is a sound wave, would not propagate."

    "Buoyancy is a force exerted by a fluid that opposes the weight of an immersed object. Archimedes' principle states that the buoyancy force that is exerted on an immersed body is equal to the weight of the fluid that the body displaces.\n",

If the sum of the moments due to gravity and buoyancy result in a restoring moment the object is stable; otherwise, it is unstable with an overturning moment (Figure 2). This effect is important to consider in designing boats and buoys."

    "Another exercise to demonstrate the application of the buoyancy force is to examine the buoyancy frequency of an object displaced in a fluid. This can be done by placing a styrofoam cup in a basin of water and adding different amounts of weight to the cup. If you impart a downward force to the cup it will oscillate. This motion may be hard to capture visually, as the system is heavily damped by friction, but is given by $ ùëß(ùë°)=ùëß_0+ùê¥_0 cos‚Å°(ùëÅùë°)$. The oscillation frequency ($N$) is given by:   \n",

For $\\frac{\\partial \\rho (z)}{\\partial z} <0$, as in most water, $z(t)$ has oscillating solutions with frequency $N$. This frequency only depends on the density of the displaced parcel and the density gradient of the surrounding fluid, and not on the magnitude of the initial displacement."
