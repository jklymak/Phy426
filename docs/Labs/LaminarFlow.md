## Taylor-Couette

Show the effects of changing the rotation rate for Taylor-Couette flow.. Try
and show that at low Reynolds numbers the flow is reversible by "mixing" and
then "unmixing" the dye.  

## Osborne Reynolds demonstration

Show the difference between flows as the Reynlds number is increased using
the Osborne-Reynolds apparatus
