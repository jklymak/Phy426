title: Pressure and Buoyancy
---

## Hydrostatic pressure and nozzle velocity

Fill a large bucket that has a hole in the side, but near the bottom.  As the bucket empties, record the height of the water to the hole, and the distance from the hole the water squirts before it strikes the ground.  

## Siphon

Repeat the experiment but with a hose that goes higher than the surface of the reservoir, but outlets below the surface of the reservoir.  

## Pressure in a moving flow

We have a venturi apparatus that allows water to flow through pipes of various thickness.  Explain why the water level at each measurement pipe is different.  Does the difference increase as the flow rate increases?  Is there a power law?  

## Stability

Find a number of things that float and discuss their stability to tipping as they float in different orientations.
