title: Pressure and Buoyancy
---

## Hydrostatic pressure and nozzle velocity

Fill a large bucket that has a hole in the bottom up to the top.  As the bucket empties, record the height of the water to the hole, and the distance from the hole the water squirts before it strikes the ground.  

## Siphon

Repeat the experiment but with a hose that goes higher than the surface of the reservoir, but outlets below the surface of the reservoir.  

## Pressure in a moving flow

Show using the vertical pipes that the flow in the narrower pipe has less pressure than the flow in the thicker pipe.  Why?  How does the difference vary with reservoir height?  

## Stability

Find a number of things that float and discuss their stability to tipping as they float in different orientations.
