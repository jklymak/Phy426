## Hydraulic flow lab

We have a nice flow-metered table: using the instructions they provide show that as the flow speed increases the reservoir height increases.  By what power law?  

## Hydraulic hysteresis

Using the estuary tank shown in the first class, explore hydraulic hysteresis:

    1. set up a channel flow with an obstacle half way down the channel.  Make sure that the downstream reservoir is so low the channel is dry to start.  Set a moderately slow flow speed and demonstrate the evolution of the flow
        - Approximately how long does it take for the water to start spilling over the obstacle?  How would you suggest we estimate this?
        - Approximately how much longer does it take to get into steady state?  
        - Note the downstream behaviour.  Describe what happens downstream as the flow speed is increased/decreased.

    2. Make the same setup but with a shallower obstacle.  
        - does the character of the response change?

    3. Make the same setup, but fill the downstream reservoir so the water level is higher (but not as high as the obstacle crest)
        - compare and contrast to the case where the downstream channel is dry.
        - change the flow speed and note the downstream behaviour.
