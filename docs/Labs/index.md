title: Laboratory Demonstrations
---

## Overview

Fluid dynamics has many un-intuitive properties that benefit from seeing them
in action.  You and a partner will do a laboratory demonstration during the
semester, and present the demo to the class.  

## Components

### Prep:

You will come in before the demo for a few hours, arranged with you, Nik, and
Andrew, and set up and practice the demonstrations.  You will want to take
some pictures, make some movies, and do some simple measurements as suggested
in the description of the demo.  

### Presentation:

You will give the demos, usually on a Thursday afternoon.  You should probably
have a few slides prepared from your pictures and/or movies in case you got a
better version of the demo previously.  You should also show any data you
collected as you varied parameters during the demo or in your prep before
the demo.  If you were given power laws or dependencies in the write up or you
found some on your own show that the experiment follows those dependencies.  Or
if it does not, discuss what experimental issues prevent us from seeing them.

### Write up:

A write up is due the following week.  This is a few pages:
 - how you did the demo (procedure)
 - results
   - photos
   - movies
 - discussions and hints for next time.
Please format as a *webpage*, either as a jupyter Notebook, or a markdown
document.  Hand in to me by email.
