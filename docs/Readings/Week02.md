title: Reading Week 02; Conservation Laws
---

## Reading:  
  - Chapter 2: This chapter is about Cartesian Tensors which are a very
  important mathematical concept.  Hopefully you have seen before.  Skimming this chapter is useful, but our use of it will be peripheral in the course.
  - Chapter 3: This material will be covered as we need it in the lectures
  that follow.  
  - Chapter 4: Read most of this chapter:
    - conservation of mass (and the Boussinesq Approximation)
    - conservation of momentum
    - Bernoulli's Equation.  
    - skim/skip thermodynamics.  Of course we love thermodynamics, but the
    practical applications are limited for most of fluid mechanics.  


## Q1:  Steady flow in channel

Imagine steady water flow down a rectangular channel that is 1-m wide.  
For specificity, assume the water is 1 m deep.
  - Imagine dye is injected in the channel at four spots across the channel
  and sketch what the dye would trace out in time.  
  - If there is no friction, and the water doesn't accelerate or decelerate,
  how much energy is need to keep it moving?  
  - If there is friction, and the flow is still steady (i.e. the friction doesn't stop it), what force might be causing the water to keep moving down-
  channel?  

## Q2: Widening channel

Imagine the channel (gradually) widens to 2-m wide, but the flow remains
steady (in time); again assume *no friction*:
  - sketch what the dye streaks might look like as the channel widens.  Why did
  you choose these paths?
  - if you sketched your dye streaks properly, what do you thinks is conserved
  between them?  
  - Assuming there is no friction, what forces are in the fluid that acto to
  change the flow speed?

## Q3:  Flow around a cylinder

Now imagine a very wide channel and a small cylinder placed in the flow so
that it looks like a circle from above; again assume steady flow and no
friction:
  - sketch how equally spaced dye streaks placed far upstream of the
  cylinder will deform around the cylinder.
  - what forces cause the deformation.
  - change co-ordinate systems for a minute, and imagine the cylinder
  being pulled through the water.  What is the net rate of work (F*u)
  necessary to pull it through the water?
