title: Reading Week 03 Vorticity
---

## Reading:  
  - Chapter 5: Skip/skim the section on the
  "Vorticity Equation in a Rotating Frame"


### Q1: Meaning of vorticity

Solid-body rotation is what we learned about in high-school.  What is the
relationship between $\omega$ and the rate of angular rotation $d\theta/dt$?

### Q2: Conservation of vorticity

Consider the vorticity equation:

$$ \frac{D\mathbf{\omega}}{Dt} = \left(\mathbf{\omega}\cdot\nabla \right)\mathbf{u} + \nu \nabla^2\mathbf{\omega}  $$
