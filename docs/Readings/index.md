The class will do a number of weekly readings.  They will be handed in
by committing onto GitHub, and I'll check them periodically to make sure
you are doing them/keeping up w/ material.

  - [Week 01; Equation of State, Pressure, Hydrostatics](./Week01/)
  - [Week 02; Conservation Laws](./Week02/)
  - [Week 03; Conservation of Vorticity](./Week03/)


## Submitting readings:


### Step 1: Sign up for github account.

If you don't already have a [github](https://github.com) account, sign up
for one.  

### Step 2: Get a git client for your machine

Git is the software that does version control.  It allows you to work
with "git repositories" and save "commits" of your work.  These repositories
can be synced with `https://github.com` so I can see your work.  

I can't really help you with getting a git client for your machine, but
`git` clients are extremely easy to look
up online for any architecture.  On a mac I do `brew install git`.  

I exclusively use a command-line client. You can also use a
[GUI git client](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis/).  

### Step 3: Make a new repository and clone it on your machine.

Use the "Plus" sign in the upper right, and create a new repository.  Name it
something like "Phy426". Follow the
[instructions here](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)
to clone the new repository on your machine.

### Step 4: Upload your answers!

Your answers can be PDFs, png/gif, or text files
([Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) is great
because it can accept math).  PNG/gif are better for sketeches (legible
camera uploads are fine.)  

Put the file in your `Phy426/` directory.  To upload:

  1. `git add Phy426/Week01.md`
  2. `git commit -a -m "Week01"`
  3. `git push`

*Please* label so I can tell what week you are responding to.  If you prefer,
you can add subdirectories:

```
Phy426/Week01/Boo.txt
Phy426/Week02/Pic.jpg
...
```

### Step 5: Share the link to your project:

Send me the link to the project.  No need to send me an email everytime you
upload something.  I'll check periodically that you are doing the work.
