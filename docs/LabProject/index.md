title: Laboratory Project

## Goal

The goal of this project is to get you into the lab and learning some
fluid mechanics by getting your hands wet.  Fluid dynamics requires a
degree of intuition, and the best way to get this is by playing with
fluids!

A second goal is for you to do a bit of research on your topic,
and writing a good 3 or so page introduction to the topic.  This will
practice your research skills, assimilation, and writing skills.  

The third goal is to practice presenting your research, both orally,
and in written form.  

In order to encourage you to not procrastinate, and make rapid
progress, there are milestones to be completed.

Both Nik and I are available for discussion at anytime about your
project; as below, there will be a formal meeting with both of us.   


## Timeline

### 22 Jan: Project chosen (10%)

Free marks for choosing your project.  

You should choose to examine a phenomena in some detail, preferably
with as quantitative measurements as possible, and through some
fraction of parameter space.  A list of possible ideas are given
below.  You could also check out
[An Album of Fluid Motion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Album_of_Fluid_Motion)
which I can lend you, or various online
versions of the same.  The
[Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics](http://www.annualreviews.org/journal/fluid) often has excellent review articles
that could inspire an idea.  

[Lab Project Ideas](LabProjIdeas/)

#### Fallback project

Its possible your primary project will not work, or not be feasible.
You won't be penalized for this, but a) check w/ us early, and b) have
a few other ideas in mind!

#### To submit:

Submit, by email, a 1-page PDF describing  
    - your primary experimental phenomena
    - what equipment is required
    - what your experimental procedure will be
Include contingency plans for the above.  Also very briefly outline a
Fallback project in case your first choice is completely infeasible.  

Grading: this part will be graded for thought put into your proposal,
not whether it is "right" or not.  So don't be shy about proposing
something interesting.  Mostly the grade is just to encourage you to
get this done.  

### 8 Feb: Written Introduction draft submitted (10%)

 - also, you should have made an appojntment to talk to Nik and I (together) about your project.  This can be during the lab time.

Your final report of your work will have a short introduction, 3-4 pages,
not including figures, double spaced 12pt font. It does not depend on
your lab experiment results, so this milestone is to encourage you to
draft it ahead of time.  

The introduction should summarize
in 3 or 4 paragraphs a) what you are planning to do, b) why it is
important, and c) what has been done on it before. It should also
include a short synopsis of any theory relating to the problem. You
should have 4-5 references that are included in this short write up.
The goal here is to make sure you have thought about your experiment's
place in the literature, and have made yourself familiar with some of
the previous knowledge about how it is going to work.  For your
literature review [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com) is often very helpful.

### 5-9 Mar: Class presentations (20%)

Two class periods are set aside for you to give a 15 minute talk on
your project to the rest of the class.  Make sure to briefly explain
the background and theory, and then to present your results as clearly
as possible.  

### 29 Mar: Final project due (60%)

The final project is due at this time. It consists of your
introduction, your experimental setup, your results, and any
discussion you might have.  A typical report would be on the order of
8-10 pages, double spaced, not including figures, but shorter is fine if
you can get everything across.  Longer likely means a) you did too
much or b) you need to cut to the chase in your discussion.

#### Rubric

##### 10 Intro
   - outlines the problem, and some of the work that has already been
     done on it.  
   - outlines the major non-dimensional numbers controlling the flow,
     and explains where in that parameter space you will be operating

##### 7 Procedures
   - Explains in enough detail that it could be reproduced what you
     did to make your experiment work.  Diagrams are helpful.

##### 13 Results and analysis
   - Shows the results as completely as practical.  
   - Summarize results in terms of non-dimensional parameters if you
     can.
   - This grade includes how good your presentation is, so spend some
     effort making this clear and looking good.

##### 10 Conclusions and Discussion
   - Summarize what you learned.  Make sure you know the difference
     between "Results" or "Conclusions" and "Discussion".  If you
     proved x depends on y, that is a conclusion.  If you suspect x
     depends on y, that is Discussion
   - Discuss unknowns in your results, and try to discuss what you
     would do next time to improve or build in your experiment.


## Timing guidelines - how much is expected?

Obviously you all have other courses, and one could occupy oneself
fulltime in a fluid mechanics laboratory.  Bear in mind that most of
the papers you have read represent months, if not years, of sustained
effort, often by teams of skilled researchers. You don't want to do
something too hokey, but conversely, don't bite off more than you can
chew.  

A good rule of thumb would be 3 hours for set up, and another 6-9
hours for your experiments.  The research might take a bit longer
depending on your skills, but if you are spending much more than 6
hours researching and writing your introduction, you are probably
reading the literature too in depth, or suffering writers block!  For
the former, try to get the main point of the paper as it applies to
your project - you aren't going to explain the whole paper, just how
it relates.  For the latter, just write something, don't fuss with
formatting or how it sounds.  Get something on paper, you can always
perfect it later.

Based on this, we expect this will occupy 24 hours, or about 2 hours
per week during term.  You will probably want to have a concentrated
burst of activity while running your experiment. Please make sure you
have scheduled lab time with Nik to avoid conflicts with other lab
users.
