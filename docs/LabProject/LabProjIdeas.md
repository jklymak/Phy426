  1. Open Channel Flow:

      1. Solitary waves. (Some simple experiments can be done easily, and a guide to a project has been prepared as Experiment 86.)

      2. Hydraulics, such as critical flow over a bump. Flow through a constriction can also be investigated.

  2. Stratified Flow:

     1. Two-layer (DO NOT USE SALT IN THE 7m TANK). Possible projects include investigation of:
       - gravity currents, bottom, surface and interfacial,
       - interfacial waves,
       - selective withdrawal.

     2. Linear salt stratification can be achieved using a two-bucket filling technique. Possible projects (in a small to medium tank) include investigation of:
	    - a turbulent plume of dense water entering from above but settling at mid-depth because of entrainment,
	    -  an ice block melting in a stratified fluid,
	    - internal waves.

  3. Viscous Flow (using corn syrup):

     1. Viscous coiling; what determines the frequency?

     2.  Magma convection; how does a buoyant source of light fluid force its way up through a denser but very viscous fluid?

     3. Fingering on an inclined plane; what happens when a viscous fluid is released from behind a barrier on a slope?

  4. Rotating Flow (a rotating table is available, but record players are also surprisingly effective):

     1. Spin-up and spin-down.

     2. Taylor columns.

     3.  Rotating convection; how is it different?

     4.  The "annulus experiment" (outside wall heated, inside wall cooled).

     5.  A melting ice block in either fresh or salty water.

     6.  Discharge through a ring of a (dyed) fluid less dense than the container of salty water. (This is a model of coastal currents.)

  5. Convection:

     1. Double diffusive convection  (heater and beaker).

     2. Salt fingering.

  6. Miscellaneous:

     1. The salt oscillator (syringe and beaker), and various other
 systems which are unstable and show oscillatory behaviour. A guide
 has been prepared as Experiment 87.

     2. Vortex rings (use a rubber membrane over one end of a can with a hole in the opposite end).

     3. River meanders (best done outside!).

     4. Spinning bucket with holes (ditto).

     5. Suspensions (particles and beaker).
