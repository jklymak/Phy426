## Reading:  
  - Chapter 1:
    - Skim surface tension,
    - Skim transport phenomena: we will cover later.

## Q1: What does density (tend) to depend on?

Consider the density of fresh water or dry air.  What two
thermodynamic variables does the density of the fluid depend on, and in
what sense?  

## Q2: What *is* pressure?

Briefly explain what pressure is in terms of molecular motion.  If we put
a surface in the fluid what effect does the pressure have on the
surface?  Why doesn't pressure have a direction?  

## Q3: How does pressure support water columns?

Suppose we have a U-shaped pipe with a constant cross-sectional area of
$0.1 m^2$. Water filled up to 1 m above the bottom of the U.  A weight
of 10 kg is placed on a plunger on one side of the pipe. What will the
water levels be in each side of the pipe?  

## Q4: Kinematics: How does "advection" change the Eulerian perception of a quantity?

Suppose the concentration of Caffeine in a river is measured to be 100 g/m^3
at one station, and 150 g/m^3 at a station 100 km upstream.  if the river is
flowing downstream at 1 m/s, what do you think the concentration will be
at the downstream station three hours later?
