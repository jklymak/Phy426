title: Reading Week 03 Vorticity

## Reading:  
  - Chapter 5: Skip/skim the section on the
  "Vorticity Equation in a Rotating Frame"


### Q1: Meaning of vorticity

Solid-body rotation is what we learned about in high-school.  What is the
relationship between $\omega$ and the rate of angular rotation $d\theta/dt$?

### Q2: Conservation of vorticity

Consider the vorticity equation:

$$ \frac{D\mathbf{\omega}}{Dt} = \left(\mathbf{\omega}\cdot\nabla \right)\mathbf{u} + \nu \nabla^2\mathbf{\omega}  $$

Now assume that $\nu$ is very small (frictionless), $\omega$ is only in the vertical direction, and that
$\partial u/\partial z = \partial v / \partial z = 0$, and that
$\partial w/\partial z > 0$.  Show $D\omega/Dt > 0$ if $\omega>0$ (obvious),
and more importantly argue why from the principles you learned in high-school physics.  

### Q3: Kelvin's Circulation Theorem

Prove to yourself that the Circulation theorem works for both a solid-body
vortex and for an irrotational vortex.
