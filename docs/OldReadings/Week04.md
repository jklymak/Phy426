title: Reading Week 04 Gravity Waves
---

## Reading:  
  - Chapter 7: Read up until (and including) "Group Velocity and Wave
  Dispersion"

### Q1: Why do wave crests move froward?  

 - sketch the orbitals in a surface wave after Figure 7.6, but include an orbital at the top crest of the wave, and one at the trough.  Do the convergences and divergences make the wave crest move forward?  How do you get waves going in the negative x direction using the same logic?

### Q2: Dispersion relation:

Use a graphics package to quickly plot up the dispersion relation (7.40).  Indicate where the deep-water and shallow-water asymptotes are on your plot, and sketch (by hand if you like) the dispersion relations at the asymptotes.

### Q3: Energetics of Waves

Why is 7.56 the only term in the energy equation for surface waves?  (see notes
from week 2/3 about energy equations...)
