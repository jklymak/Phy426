The class will do a number of weekly readings.  They will be handed in
by committing onto GitHub, and I'll check them periodically to make sure
you are doing them/keeping up w/ material.

  - [Week 01; Equation of State, Pressure, Hydrostatics](https://goo.gl/forms/7zuqVxKPvucIgzyo1)
  - [Week 02; Conservation Laws](./Week02/)
  - [Week 03; Conservation of Vorticity](./Week03/)
  - [Week 04; Surface waves](./Week04/)
